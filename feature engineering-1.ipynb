    "Missing values in a dataset are values that are not present for some observations or features. They can occur for various\n",

    "Outliers in a dataset are data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data. They are observations that are\n",

    "can occur for various reasons, including data entry errors, measurement errors, natural variations, or genuinely rare events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common characteristics of outliers:\n",

    "7.Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN): This technique removes majority class samples that are misclassified by their nearest\n",
    "  neighbors from the same class. It helps in removing noisy samples from the majority class.\n",

    "6.Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Regression (SMOTER): SMOTER is a variation of SMOTE designed for regression\n",

    "7.Borderline-SMOTE: Like SMOTE, but it focuses on generating synthetic samples for the minority class instances that are on \n",
